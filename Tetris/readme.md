Classic Tetris game written in Javascript using React and stylized using CSS. 
The game can be launched from a local machine, and features the classic 
tetromines. Scores are based on rows cleared and more points for multiple 
rows cleared at one time. The arrow keys can be used to manipulate the tetromines
(left, right, down go that direction respectively and up rotates the tetromines).
